                    company named Gotym Technologies as a sales manager, though I don't get paid yet for the work I do in the tech company I am yet optimistic that if I put in the work the Lord

                <p class="txt">I have always dreamed of a life full of adventure and wonder not being limited to experiencing
                    life according to how much money I have or the work that I do.
                    I dream of traveling with my future wife and finding joy in all that God has given us while yet being
                    able to work on the go thus I dream of owning my own tech company developing software and security.

                <p class="txt">After serving my mission I returned home and began speaking to the girl I met while yet on mission named Rebecca Comrie
                    After some time my parents immigrated and I moved from my home in KZN durban to Centurion Johannesburg to be with her,
                    live has been hard studying and trying to make ends meet so I can stay by her side but every moment with her is worth 
                    any effort I had to put in.
                    almost a year later now and we are still going strong, she still makes me feel like the ruler of the world
                    and drives me to be a better man.
                    I love her to the ends of the earth and back.
