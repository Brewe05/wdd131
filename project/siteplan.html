        <h3>My Name Is Brent Welsford</h3>
        <p>I am a <strong>25-year-old male</strong> from South Africa. This website is about my life and the decisions I made to serve a full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I created this website as a project for my BYU assignment, but I hope it will help others in their decision to serve a mission. I hope you find the joy that the gospel brings as I did.</p>
        <p><em>Enjoy my website!</em></p>

        <img src="images/full_moon.jpg" alt="Image of dark night with moon on horizon" loading="lazy" class="main-image">
        <p>I was an average person, just working and studying while still living with my parents. At 20, life seemed stagnant until one day at another ward, I met a girl who changed everything. I realized I needed direction.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"After praying with intent, I felt the call to serve a mission. I had been prepared."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This experience opened my eyes to the possibilities of a life dedicated to serving others and following the Lordâ€™s guidance.</p>
