            I was called in November 2021 to serve in the Johannesburg South Africa area, and in December of that year I left to serve the Lord and the people for 2 years. My mission was difficult as it is meant to be; it challenged me in so many ways. But not a second went by where I regretted going. To be able to be so close to the spirit and to meet so many amazing people and see the changes that happen in their lives because of the gospel is something truly life-changing.
            I learned direction in my life about what I wanted, and I even met the girl of my dreams. Of course, I had to wait until my mission was finished before speaking to her, but the Lord blessed me in so many ways on my mission and promised me that it was not yet over.
