        <h2>Life After Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Returning from my mission on December 1, 2023, was not how I had imagined it...
        </p>
        <p>
            It was strange being back and seeing that the world had moved on even though I hadn't been there.
            The girl I met on mission became my girlfriend but it was hard because I lived 600km away from her.
            I decided to make a change.
        </p>

        <p>
            I moved to Johannesburg to be with her...
        </p>
        <p>We have been together ever since, The Lord will bless you as he has blessed me,
            I will never regret serving my mission.
